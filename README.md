Data Visualization #1:  
Our first data visualization shows every birth location on a scatterplot, which roughly shows the geographic shape of the world. As such, 
the latitudal and longitudal positions of the birth place are used to plot the node. After that, we compiled the genre/professional role 
of all of the people who were born at said location. Depending on which genre had the greatest frequency of birth, the node was colored
accordingly, which is denoted by the legend. Lastly, the visualization helps to visualize where persons of cultural significance emerge. 
One can observe places that may be disposed towards generating people of certain cultural genres.

Data Visualization #2:  
Our second data visualization shows a redesign of Figure 2D from the original report. The same data is presented as the original, but 
more than a few modifications have been made to improve the quality of the data visualization. Data can be hovered over to show a clear 
trend among cities. Additionally, the colors were changed to better highlight individual paths between nodes.

Data Visualization #3:  
Our third data visualization is a new plot of male birth versus female birth over time. The plot helps to demonstrate cultural trends and 
to observe potential gender biases. The X-axis shows the progression of time while the Y-axis shows the number of people born in a given 
century. Color denotes whether a line represents male births, female births, or unspecified births. Unspecified births were kept in the 
plot to show the potential for data bias and the presence of an unpredictable variable, which makes up roughly 5-10% of the total data.
